 Def ObservableObject:
  - ObservableObject is a protocol that allows SwiftUI views to observe changes in data.
 Layman Def: Imagine you have a whiteboard that shows some information â€” like a user's name.
             Now, suppose this whiteboard is shown to many people (views). If someone changes the name,
             everyone looking at the whiteboard should see the updated name instantly.
             In SwiftUI, this whiteboard is a class marked as ObservableObject.

   @stateObject is a property wrapper that allows you to create an instance of an ObservableObject
   @observedObject is a property wrapper that allows you to observe changes to an ObservableObject instance
   
   Diff b/w stateObject and observedObject:
   @StateObject and @ObservedObject are both property wrappers in SwiftUI used to observe changes to an ObservableObject.
   However, they differ in how they handle the lifecycle of the observed object.
   @StateObject is used when the view owns the object, ensuring its persistence across view updates.
   @ObservedObject is used when the view receives the object from an external source, and SwiftUI doesn't manage its lifecycle
