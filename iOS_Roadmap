## üìÖ Learning Plan (Balanced for 1‚Äì2 hrs weekdays + 2‚Äì3 hrs weekends)

Assumes **8‚Äì10 hrs/week**: 6 during weekdays, 4 on weekends  
Also assumes **~2 hrs/week on DSA/system design**

### üìå Phase 1 (Weeks 1‚Äì4): Foundations

| Week | Topics | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Swift Language | Optionals, protocols, extensions, generics, value vs reference |
| 2 | Memory Mgmt | ARC, retain cycles, deinit, Instruments Leaks |
| 3 | Concurrency | GCD, OperationQueue, async/await, structured concurrency |
| 4 | UIKit + SwiftUI | View lifecycle, bridging UIKit <-> SwiftUI |

### üìå Phase 2 (Weeks 5‚Äì8): App Infrastructure

| Week | Topics | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| 5 | App Lifecycle | AppDelegate, SceneDelegate, app states, background fetch |
| 6 | Networking | URLSession, REST, Codable, retry, error handling |
| 7 | Local Storage | UserDefaults, FileManager, Core Data intro |
| 8 | Core Data Deep Dive | Context, parent/child, batch ops, perf tuning |

### üìå Phase 3 (Weeks 9‚Äì12): Architecture + Testing

| Week | Topics | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| 9 | DI & MVVM | Resolver, constructor injection, refactoring MVC to MVVM |
| 10 | Clean Architecture | Layers, protocols, use cases, coordinator pattern |
| 11 | Unit & UI Testing | XCTest, mocks, stubs, test targets |
| 12 | Snapshot Testing + Tools | Point-Free snapshot tests, testable arch, CI integration |

### üìå Phase 4 (Weeks 13‚Äì16): Pro-Grade Extras

| Week | Topics | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| 13 | Animations | UIView animations, Core Animation, SwiftUI |
| 14 | Instruments | Time Profiler, Allocations, FPS, app startup time |
| 15 | Push + Deep Linking | Notifications, Universal Links, custom schemes |
| 16 | Release Tooling | Fastlane, TestFlight, Crashlytics, app signing |

## ‚è± Estimated Completion Time: **4 months (16 weeks)**

- ~1.5 hrs/day average: **doable but tight**
- Miss a week and it compounds fast

## üìå Tracking Progress

- [ ] Trello board or Notion page with each topic as a checklist
- [ ] GitHub repo per learning phase (e.g., `iOSMemory`, `SwiftConcurrencyExamples`)
- [ ] Weekly reflection log (bullet points only)

## üö® Brutal Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Mindless tutorial hell**
2. **Skipping Instruments/tools**
3. **Just learning SwiftUI**
4. **Shallow learning**
5. **Skipping testing**
